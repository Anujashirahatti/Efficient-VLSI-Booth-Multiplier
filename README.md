## Booth‚Äôs Algorithm for Efficient VLSI Multiplication

### üìå Introduction

Booth's Algorithm is widely utilized in the **VLSI (Very Large-Scale Integration)** domain for implementing efficient multiplication, particularly in **digital signal processing** and **arithmetic processing units** within processors. It optimizes multiplication by encoding binary numbers to reduce the number of **partial products** required in binary multiplication.

In VLSI design, reducing **gate counts, power consumption, and silicon area** is essential. Booth's Algorithm addresses these needs by efficiently handling **signed and unsigned numbers** through a process called **Booth encoding**, which reduces the complexity of multiplication by grouping bits and skipping unnecessary additions.

#### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize Variables**  
   - Store multiplicand (M) and multiplier (Q) in binary.  
   - Initialize `Q-1 = 0` and accumulator `A = 0`.  
   - Determine bit-width `n` from M and Q.

2. **Set Iteration Counter**  
   - Counter = `n` (number of bits in Q).

3. **Check Last Two Bits (Q and Q-1)**  
   - If `Q0 = 1` and `Q-1 = 0` ‚Üí `A = A - M`.  
   - If `Q0 = 0` and `Q-1 = 1` ‚Üí `A = A + M`.  
   - Else ‚Üí No change.

4. **Arithmetic Right Shift (ARS)**  
   - Perform ARS on `[A, Q, Q-1]`.

5. **Decrement Counter**  
   - Counter = Counter - 1.

6. **Repeat Steps 3‚Äì5** until counter = 0.

7. **Final Output**  
   - Product is stored in `[A, Q]`.
